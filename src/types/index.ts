// This file can be used to define common TypeScript types for the application.

// Example:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

// Currently, no application-wide custom types are defined here.
// Specific types for AI flows are co-located with their respective flow files.
// Form-specific types are typically inferred using Zod within the form components.
